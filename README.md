# My-Portfolio
In this project I found myself searching through google quite often. Did a lot of research and playing with bootstrap code to make it into the style I wanted. This is my first full attempt at designing a website with no skeleton layout, and its honeslty rewarding to see it in action even if it isn't the fanciest. I came to coding because I thought it would be an enjoyable career path, and I was 100 percent correct. Within my website are placeholders that will later be filled with pictures and projects to complete my portfolio. There are also two links in my contact me page that will lead you directly to my twitter and linkedin accounts. Feel free to explore.
